# Testing: Unit, Integration, E2E

A good test suite gives you confidence to deploy.

## The Test Pyramid

Unit tests - Fast (ms), Many (100s), Isolated
Integration tests - Medium (s), Some (dozens), Real dependencies
E2E tests - Slow (min), Few (handfuls), Full system

## Unit Tests

Test one function/class in isolation. Mock external dependencies.

from unittest.mock import Mock, AsyncMock

async def test_create_order():
    repo = AsyncMock(spec=OrderRepository)
    service = OrderService(repo=repo)

    order = await service.create(user_id="u1", items=[...])

    assert order.user_id == "u1"
    repo.save.assert_awaited_once()

## Integration Tests

Test with real database. Use testcontainers.

import pytest
from testcontainers.postgres import PostgresContainer

@pytest.fixture
async def db():
    with PostgresContainer("postgres:16") as pg:
        pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(pg.get_connection_url())
        yield pool
        await pool.close()

async def test_user_repository(db):
    repo = PostgresUserRepository(db)
    user = await repo.create(email="test@example.com")
    assert user.id is not None

## E2E Tests

Test the full HTTP API.

from httpx import AsyncClient

async def test_create_order_flow():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app) as client:
        resp = await client.post("/orders", json={...})
        assert resp.status_code == 201

        order_id = resp.json()["id"]
        resp = await client.get(f"/orders/{order_id}")
        assert resp.status_code == 200

## What to Test

Must test:
- Happy path (everything works)
- Error cases (every validation failure)
- Edge cases (empty, null, max length)
- Security (unauthorized access)
- Performance (not in CI, separate)

Dont test:
- Framework behavior (FastAPI works, we tested it)
- Configuration (test that the config is valid)
- Trivial code (getters, setters, one-liners)

## Test Quality

Good tests:
- Readable (assertion = specification)
- Independent (can run in any order)
- Fast (runs in milliseconds)
- Reliable (no flaky failures)
- Focused (tests one thing)

Bad tests:
- Flaky (sometimes pass, sometimes fail)
- Slow (seconds per test)
- Brittle (break when implementation changes)
- Over-mocked (test mocks, not real code)
