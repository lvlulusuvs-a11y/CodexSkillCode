# Testing Async Code

Async code needs special care in tests.

## pytest-asyncio

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_function():
    result = await my_async_function()
    assert result == expected

## Testing Task Timeouts

async def test_timeout():
    with pytest.raises(asyncio.TimeoutError):
        async with asyncio.timeout(0.1):
            await slow_function()

## Testing Async Context Managers

async def test_context_manager():
    async with Database() as db:
        result = await db.query("SELECT 1")
        assert result is not None

## Testing Background Tasks

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_background_task():
    task = asyncio.create_task(slow_task())
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    assert not task.done()
    task.cancel()

## Testing Race Conditions

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_concurrent_access():
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        concurrent_function("a"),
        concurrent_function("b"),
        concurrent_function("c"),
    )
    assert all(r == expected for r in results)

## Mocking Async Functions

from unittest.mock import AsyncMock

async def test_with_mock():
    mock_repo = AsyncMock()
    mock_repo.get_user.return_value = User(id="u1")
    service = UserService(repo=mock_repo)
    user = await service.get_user("u1")
    assert user.id == "u1"

## Testing Event-Driven Code

Use an EventBus with testing support:

class TestEventBus(EventBus):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.published: list[tuple[str, dict]] = []

    async def publish(self, event: str, data: dict) -> None:
        self.published.append((event, data))
        await super().publish(event, data)

async def test_event_driven_service():
    bus = TestEventBus()
    service = MyService(bus=bus)

    await service.do_something()

    assert len(bus.published) == 1
    assert bus.published[0][0] == "something.done"
