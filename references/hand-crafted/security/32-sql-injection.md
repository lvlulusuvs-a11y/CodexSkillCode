# SQL Injection Prevention

SQL injection is the most dangerous vulnerability because it is
easy to miss and catastrophic when exploited.

## Use Parameterized Queries

ALWAYS use parameterized queries. NEVER use string formatting.

BAD - never do this:
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")

GOOD:
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))

## ORMs Prevent Injection

Using SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or similar:

session.query(User).filter(User.id == user_id).first()

This generates parameterized queries automatically.

## Raw SQL with ORM

Even with ORM, raw SQL needs parameters:

session.execute(
    text("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :user_id"),
    {"user_id": user_id}
)

## Dynamic Queries

Dynamic filtering needs extra care:

valid_columns = {"name", "email", "created_at"}
sort_column = request.query_params.get("sort", "created_at")

if sort_column not in valid_columns:
    raise ValueError(f"Invalid sort column: {sort_column}")

query = f"SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY {sort_column}"

Order by cannot be parameterized. Whitelist column names.

## LIKE Queries

Parameterize with LIKE:

cursor.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE %s",
    (f"%{search_term}%",)
)

## IN Clauses

cursor.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ANY(%s)",
    (user_ids,)
)

## Batch Operations

cursor.executemany(
    "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (%s, %s)",
    [("Alice", "alice@e.com"), ("Bob", "bob@e.com")]
)

## What to Check in Code Review

- [ ] No f-strings in SQL queries
- [ ] No string concatenation for SQL
- [ ] ORM used correctly (no .raw() without params)
- [ ] Dynamic column names whitelisted
- [ ] ORDER BY validated
