# Database Query Optimization

Database queries are the most common bottleneck in web applications.
Here is how I find and fix slow queries.

## Finding Slow Queries

First, enable slow query logging and find the worst offenders.

In PostgreSQL:

SELECT query, calls, total_time / calls AS avg_ms
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

## Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE

EXPLAIN ANALYZE is your best friend. Look for:

1. Seq Scan on large tables > 10000 rows
2. Sort operations on unindexed columns
3. Nested Loop joins fetching many rows
4. Actual time much higher than estimated time

## Effective Indexes

Create indexes for your most common query patterns:

For WHERE clauses:
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_user_status
ON orders(user_id, status);

For sorting:
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_created
ON orders(created_at DESC);

For covering queries (no table fetch needed):
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_covering
ON orders(user_id, status) INCLUDE (total);

## N+1 Query Problem

Bad: One query per item (N+1 round trips)
users = db.query(User).all()
for user in users:
    orders = db.query(Order).filter(user_id=user.id).all()
    user.orders = orders

Good: Batch in one query
users = db.query(User)
    .outerjoin(Order)
    .options(joinedload(User.orders))
    .all()

## Batch Operations

Bad: Individual inserts
for item in items:
    db.execute("INSERT INTO orders VALUES ($1)", item)

Good: Batch insert
db.executemany("INSERT INTO orders VALUES ($1)", items)

## Connection Pool Tuning

pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
    DATABASE_URL,
    min_size=5,
    max_size=20,
    command_timeout=30.0,
    max_inactive_connection_lifetime=300.0,
)

## What NOT to Do

1. SELECT * in production code
2. N+1 queries in loops
3. No LIMIT on queries
4. Transactions holding locks during external API calls
5. Too many indexes (each index slows writes)
6. WHERE DATE(column) = today (ignores index)
